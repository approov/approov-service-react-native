# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [3.5.8]
- **iOS Interceptor**: Redesigned `ApproovRCTInterceptor` to fix session callback handling. It now correctly intercepts sessions even when the delegate is set after session creation, ensuring compatibility with SDKs like Sentry and New Relic that use method swizzling.
- **Pinning Delegate**: Enhanced `ApproovPinningDelegate` to robustly proxy calls to the original delegate, ensuring that all `NSURLSessionDelegate` methods (including completion handlers) are correctly forwarded.
- **Dynamic Logging**: Added `ApproovService.setLogLevel(level)` to control native log verbosity at runtime. Default log level for pinning and initialization is now `INFO` (visible by default).
- **Log Constants**: Exported `ApproovService.Log` constants (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, NONE) to JavaScript.
- **Custom Delegates**: Improved support for custom `NSURLSessionDelegate` implementations by ensuring `ApproovPinningDelegate` correctly mimics the response chain of the wrapped delegate. Added `ApproovService.addAllowedDelegate(pattern)` to register custom delegates for interception.
- **Documentation**: Added `LOGGING.md` with guides for capturing Approov logs via Sentry, Datadog, and New Relic.
