# Approov Service for React Native

A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://github.com/approov/approov-ios-sdk) to enable easy integration when using [`React native`](https://reactnative.dev/) for making the API calls that you wish to protect with Approov. In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.

Please see the [Quickstart](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-react-native) for usage instructions.
